---- BEFORE COMMITTING ----

1.  Please create a temporary branch and commit your changes to that branch.
    Your branch name should be named something suitable and related to your PR
    E.g. a PR for updating a file should have a branch named <git branch -M UPDATE_FILES>

    command: git branch -M <temp branch name>

2.  Send push your temporary branch to the repository
    You should already know how to push to the repository from the terminal.
    In case, your lazy ass uses the desktop app, here is how to do that:

    (assuming you have the git repository initialised)
    (assuming you are on the temporary branch which you made for this commit)
    
    command: git branch -M <temp branch name>
    command: git add .
    command: git commit -am "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"
    command: git push -u origin <temp branch name here>

3.  Create a new pull request with the gh terminal command
    Follow the steps and give a suitable title for your PR.
    On the final step, select continue in browser and submit the PR once 
    it takes you to the webpage.

    PRs should be sent to the dev branch ONLY

    command: gh pr create -B dev

    *** WHEN IT ASKS IF TO PUSH TO REPOSITORY SELECT 'SKIP THIS STEP' ***

    *** WHEN IT ASKS FOR A TITLE PLEASE GIVE A SUITABLE TITLE NAME AND PROCEED ***

    *** WHEN IT GIVES YOU THE FINAL OPTION PLEASE CONTINUE IN BROWSER AND CREATE PR THERE ***

4.  Once redirect to the browser, create your PR from step 3. Once you have done this,
    wait for the owner to approve of it and merge it to the dev branch. Your temporary branch
    will be deleted once the merge is completed.
